<p>Iâ€™m a postdoc in the <a href="http://satijalab.org/">Satija lab</a> at the New York Genome Center. I develop computational and experimental methods for single cell biology, with a focus on integrative multi-modal assays and analysis methods.</p>
<p>I completed my PhD with <a href="http://listerlab.org/">Ryan Lister</a> at the University of Western Australia in 2018, where I studied DNA methylation and transposable elements in the model plant <em>Arabidopsis</em>.</p>
