<p>While there are very fast and easy ways to extract reads from a bam file according to mapping location, extracting reads by read name is more difficult.</p>
<p>Simple methods, like using <code>grep</code>, are incredibly slow if you want to look for more than a few reads.</p>
<p>Luckily, <code>pysam</code> allows you to index a bam file by read name (using <code>pysam.IndexedReads(AlignmentFile)</code>) while keeping the sort order. However, the index is stored in memory so this can use a lot of RAM (my tests with a 5.7 GB bam file used about 9 GB RAM).</p>
<p>I wrote a small python script (below) that uses pysam to extract reads by read name from a bam file.</p>
<p>Extracting 10 reads from a 5.7 GB bam file, just using <code>grep</code> is slightly faster than the python script:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>timstuart Altai-5$  time samtools view Altai-5_filtered.bam | grep -f reads.txt &gt; extracted

real    2m10.088s
user    2m23.107s
sys 0m35.470s

timstuart Altai-5$  time python extract_reads.py -b Altai-5_filtered.bam -n reads.txt -o python_extracted.bam

real    3m36.444s
user    3m14.744s
sys 0m18.867s
</code></pre>
<p>But extracting 200 reads using python is fast, while using <code>grep</code> ran for over an hour before I stopped the process.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>timstuart Altai-5$  time python extract_reads.py -b Altai-5_filtered.bam -n reads.txt -o python_extracted.bam

real    3m30.015s
user    3m12.738s
sys 0m15.055s</code></pre>
